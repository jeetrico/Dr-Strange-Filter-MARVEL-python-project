# 🪄 Doctor Strange AR Filter with Python, Mediapipe & OpenCV

Welcome to the **Doctor Strange AR Filter** project, where mysticism meets technology! This project leverages **Python, Mediapipe, and OpenCV** to create an interactive augmented reality (AR) filter inspired by Doctor Strange's spell-casting effects. The filter overlays magical circles onto real-time video, reacting dynamically to hand gestures.

## 🌟 Features
- **Hand Tracking & Gesture Recognition**: Uses Mediapipe to detect and track hand landmarks, making it possible to overlay effects based on specific gestures.
- **Real-Time Magical Circle Overlay**: Overlays animated mystical circles on hand movements, simulating Doctor Strange’s magic.
- **Smooth Performance**: Optimized for real-time processing using OpenCV, ensuring smooth and responsive interaction.

## ⚙️ Project Structure
- `main.py`: Contains the core application logic, initializing the webcam, processing frames, tracking hands, and applying AR effects.
- `functions.py`: Provides helper functions for hand landmark processing, distance calculations, line drawing, and image overlay.

## 🖥️ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Mediapipe
- OpenCV
- Numpy

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JeetRico/doctor-strange-ar-filter.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project
Simply run the `main.py` file:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📝 Configuration
- Adjust camera settings and overlay parameters in `config.json`.
- You can customize the rotation speed, line colors, and hand gesture sensitivity as per your preference.

## 📂 Files & Directories
- **`config.json`**: Customize camera, overlay paths, and line settings.
- **`overlays/`**: Contains the magical circle images that overlay in real-time based on gestures.
